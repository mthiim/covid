      <h1>COVID-19 status in Denmark by regions</h1>
      <p>This page shows time series data of COVID-19 infections country-wise and in the different Danish regions. The data has been smoothed using 7-day moving averages.
      <p>Some graphs show the daily number of infected whereas others shows it normalized against population size (same measure as  Ministry of Foreign Affairs is using).
      <p>The raw data is fetched directly from <a href="https://www.ssi.dk/sygdomme-beredskab-og-forskning/sygdomsovervaagning/c/covid19-overvaagning">Statens Serum Institut (SSI)</a> and will update when they publish a new file (usually happens on weekdays around 14).
      <p>Note: Since the reported infections for a given date are often incomplete for 1-2 days, we ignore 2 days by default.<p>However, you can adjust here (0-10 days):
